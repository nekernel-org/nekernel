# The `/props/kern_ver` NVRAM variable

The `/props/kern_ver` variable is used to track NeKernel's current version in a BCD format.

- Use it to track the current's NeKernel version, in order to adapt your drivers to it.
- It is also useful to keep track of it, for other purposes (bug tracking, development of new features)
